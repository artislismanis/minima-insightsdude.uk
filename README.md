## What is this?

This is a copy of Jekyll's default theme gem ([minima 2.5.1](https://github.com/jekyll/minima/releases/tag/v2.5.1)) hosted separately for use with [jekyll-remote-theme](https://github.com/benbalter/jekyll-remote-theme) plugin and tweaked to meet the requirements of my blog at [https://insightsdude.uk](https://insightsdude.uk).

## Why do I need it?

This repository is very specific to my own needs, but maybe can serve as an inspiration for your Jekyll set-up. `jekyll-remote-theme` plugin provides a neat way to separate your templating code from your blog content when using Jekyll and this repo is part of my implementation of the approach.

## OK, how do I get started?

Just follow the instructions for `jekyll-remote-theme` plugin: install the gem, enable plugin and specify the remote theme to be used with your Jekyll site.

## What else?

Can't think of anything right now, but probably worth using this section to document any specific tweaks made to the stock template.
